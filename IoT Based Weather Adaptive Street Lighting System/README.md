# IoT-Based Weather Adaptive Street Lighting System

## Project Description

The IoT-Based Weather Adaptive Street Lighting System leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize street lighting based on real-time weather conditions. This system adjusts the intensity of street lights to improve energy efficiency and ensure adequate illumination during adverse weather conditions. By using weather data and light sensors, the system reduces energy consumption and enhances road safety, contributing to smarter urban infrastructure.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT Sensors:** For detecting weather conditions and ambient light levels.
- **Networking Protocols:** To enable communication between IoT devices and the central control system.
- **Data Processing Tools:** For analyzing weather data and adjusting lighting settings.
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C/C++ (for sensor and control system programming).
- **Cloud Platforms:** For data storage and remote system management (if applicable).

## Project Outcome

- **Energy Efficiency:** Reduced energy consumption by adjusting lighting based on weather conditions.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Improved road visibility and safety during adverse weather.
- **Smart Urban Infrastructure:** Contributed to the development of intelligent city systems through adaptive lighting.
- **Real-Time Adjustments:** Enabled automatic adjustments to street lighting based on current weather data.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Install IoT sensors on street poles for weather and light detection.
   - Connect sensors to a central control unit.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Upload the sensor and control system code to the microcontrollers.
   - Configure the networking protocols for communication between devices.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Set up the data processing algorithms to analyze weather conditions and adjust lighting.
   - Deploy the system to a cloud platform if remote monitoring and management are required.

## Usage

- The system automatically adjusts street light brightness based on real-time weather data.
- Monitor system performance and make adjustments through the control interface (if applicable).
